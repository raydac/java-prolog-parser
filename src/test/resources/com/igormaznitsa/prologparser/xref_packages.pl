/** <module> Find dependencies between packages

This script is  work  in  progress   to  find  dependencies  between the
packages. These dependencies will be reflected   in  the cmake data such
that we can automatically pull in dependent packages.

The biggest hurdle is  finding  from  which   package  a  file  that  is
installed in the library comes.
